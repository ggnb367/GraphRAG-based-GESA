# GraphRAG-based-GESA
This project replaces conventional GSEA with subgraph matching to extract phenotype-associated subgraphs and incorporates them as external knowledge into a GraphRAG retrieval-augmented framework, thereby enhancing the LLM’s reasoning and generation to produce highly readable, natural-language biological explanations.
